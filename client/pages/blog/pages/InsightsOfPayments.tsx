            <p>In the complex web of electronic transactions, the term "interchange" stands as a pivotal and often misunderstood element. At its core, interchange refers to the fee exchanged between banks involved in a transaction, encompassing both the issuing bank (the one that issues the credit or debit card) and the acquiring bank (the one that processes the transaction for the merchant). </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
              Interchange rates are not arbitrary; they are meticulously calculated based on various factors. These include the type of card used, the nature of the transaction (e.g., online or in-person), and the risk associated with the transaction. Diving into the nuances of interchange rates allows businesses to comprehend the financial dynamics of each transaction and optimize costs accordingly.</p>
